The overall functionality and features of 'rooms' are great and I find them very useful which in turn saves a lot of time and effort.\nOther all  basic functions are present like mute notifications, online status. To add to it, you can also set push notification in case you are not available. Simple yet very useful feature.\nThen there's smart reply and desktop notifications feature too.

I never had any problem creating room , in fact once I have to create a room with a lot of members from different projects but never faced and delays or problems with it. You can create multiple threads in a room which is very useful feature. You can also customize name of the room as per your need and project.\nThen there are groups which are very similar to a group in any messaging app. You can add multiple people but it's a single threaded chat. this is basically a personal group and rooms are for primarily for project related conversations. Search feature is also useful and easy. You can also search individually in a room. The results are easy to obtain  and very helpful.\nFurthermore, a great feature is, you can edit you messages. A lot of times we enter incorrect information in the message which can create confusion. You can edit it or delete as required by the user. I personally, find this feature very user friendly.\nYou can also shared a file form google drive directly or from your desktop. Additionally, there's a shortcut for video meeting, which when clicked send video meeting invite and the best part, creates dial in number is automatically generated which saves a lot of time.",

Foremost is the way in which content can be directly shared in the chat window such as images or image previews from URL resources. Rich content can simply be pasted directly into Google chat and seamlessly integrated into the conversation. In Skype, copy pasting an image results in the image being sent as an attached file which is disruptive and really negates the convenience of sending an image over IM versus more conventional means such as e-mail. \n\n\nOverall Google Chat offers a modern approach to enterprise instant messaging that simply works and works well.",

On the other side of the fence Skype users are migrating to a more Discord or Slack like application called Microsoft Teams.

Thanks to him, for instance, every time you paste in a link in Google Chat, a MASSIVE preview bubble appears, and there's no way to disable this. He seems to think it's the bee's knees."

This is fine generally speaking, but does make the experience unlike that of using messenger by facebook when you want to interact with many people at once or view past conversations quickly. The searching functionality is also baked into email search which makes it hard to find things that were in chat but not email without looking up specific search filters you wouldn't use elsewhere.

As an educator in particular, it is very helpful for me to send a parent a message when I see that they are online rather than having to wait for them to reply to an email. This helps me get things done quickly and to give and get feedback in my work. This also applies to my friends and family, many of whom have Gmail in the background. I love utilizing all of Google's tools because everything is so centralized in one area and helps me be efficient and quick. Plus I love that I can start a video call and add people to my conversations!!",
          "cons": "What I like least about Google Chat is that the chatbox is somehow inconveniently placed and I have to constantly minimize it to send an email in the background. It would be helpful if I could move the box to where I need it, or if it could detach and be placed elsewhere on the screen. The only other thing I would say is that not everyone is always on their Gmail so I would not utilize this for the same purposes as Facebook Messenger, for example, but rather to reach people I see online immediately or for communication that I do not require an immediate response from."

What’s even better is that it allows you to add a quick video chat link  within the chat function and you can instantly connect on google meets through this feature. Again, it is very handy.",

Public messaging and private messaging is a little ambiguous.

It would be nice for them to refine the user interface and also make it more robust and connected with applications​ like Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, including Drive."

You can use the online editor provided by Google. It implores developers like me to delve into developing bots to use perhaps to help teams manage tasks, etc.",

The WORST part is that it doesn't run in the background and therefore you have to have the window open for it to work. It doesn't open when you log in and unless the window is there you don't get notified."

You can chat around topics (Slack concept) so our team had a unique chat room for each of our project as well as separate rooms for chatting about bookkeeping, HR, misc, etc. You can turn off notifications for a particular chat room and only receive notifications when you are @mentioned. You can also leave and rejoin conversations. Google Chat also integrates with Asana, though I will say that we didn't end up finding much benefit from integrating the two. My favorite feature is the ability to search Google Chats in Gmail, filed under the Chats label.",
          "cons": "The notifications have been a big buggy... sometimes the second message in a conversation doesn't come through. Our company has used several platforms, our favorite so far being What's App. Compared to What's App, Google Chat is lacking. In Google Chat, you cannot respond directly to a past comment which makes things harder to follow, and you cannot add a conversation icon, so in the list of all of the chat rooms you are a part of, nothing stands out; it's harder to quickly navigate.  There are no read receipts or the ability to see when someone is typing a response."
